# The "Impossible Chessboard Problem" - Chessboard Escape Solution
The following sets are used to represent the necessary 6 bits. 
The number of heads of the coins (=True) in the respective set determines whether the respective bit is =1 or =0.

## Explanation of program execution

1. you can enter "1" or "2" at the beginning of the program:
with "1" an original example for the use of matplotlib is shown,
With "2" you get to the actual task
 
2. a solution to the actual problem is given, e.g. under

and

## Tasks and Exercises
1. compare the two codes

2. change the code so that a random distribution of coins is selected only once and is constant from then on

3. change the code so that the distribution of the coins can be entered via the console instead of the random distribution and is then constant

4. can the class "SetVectors" also be created generically for squares other than 8x8? A first attempt could be a 4x4 board as in
